      <!-- One -->
      <h1 class="one_heading">1 / Pushing the Boundaries</h1>
      <h2 class="one_author">Derek Pringle (2019)</h2>
      <p class="one_body">
        If you were brought up watching <br />cricket in the 1980s, then you'll
        <br />love this book. It's a story of one<br />
        of English cricket's most chaotic<br />
        periods told by someone who was<br />
        there. Derek is a great storyteller. <br />He played with some
        remarkable <br />characters. The tales of playing in <br />the Country
        Championship were<br />
        very funny. Read it now!!

      <!-- Two -->
      <h1 class="two_heading">2 / The Master</h1>
      <h2 class="two_author">Christopher Clarey (2022)</h2>
      <p class="two_body">
        The definitive biography of a <br />much loved sportsman. It's an <br />
        engrossing read of how an <br />intensely private person survived
        <br />20 years as a global icon. It's an <br />intimate and open account
        and <br />Roger's humility and grace shines<br />
        through the pages. He has a great <br />love for the game and it's a
        <br />brilliant read.

      <!-- Three -->
      <h1 class="three_heading">3 / Commander in Cheat</h1>
      <h2 class="three_author">Rick Reilly (2020)</h2>
      <p class="three_body">
        A fascinating on-the-ground <br />and behind-the-scenes survey of
        <br />Donald Trump's ethics deficit on <br />and off the golf course. It
        reveals <br />the absurd ways in which he lies <br />about his feats,
        and what they <br />can tell us about the way he lives<br />
        his life off the course. A hilarious<br />
        look at how Trump shamelessly <br />cheats at golf.

      <!-- Four -->
      <h1 class="four_heading">4 / Slow Getting Up</h1>
      <h2 class="four_author">Nate Jackson (2014)</h2>
      <p class="four_body">
        My favourite NFL book. An <br />unvarnished and uncensored<br />
        memoir of everyday life in the <br />most brutal of sports. A
        <br />journeyman pro footballer, this <br />is far removed from the
        glitz <br />and glamour of the SuperBowl. <br />Nate offers he offers a
        funny, <br />and shocking look at life in <br />the NFL.

      <!-- Five -->
      <h1 class="five_heading">5 / Black and Blue</h1>
      <h2 class="five_author">Paul Canoville(2008)</h2>
      <p class="five_body">
        What a brutal read. A story is<br />
        one of extreme racist bigotry, <br />shattering career-ending injury,
        a<br />
        decline into drug abuse, battles <br />against cancer, family tragedy<br />
        and a determination to beat the<br />
        odds. His own supporters even<br />
        abused him. It's a shocking read, <br />far removed from the modern
        day<br />
        sanitised image of the PL today.
